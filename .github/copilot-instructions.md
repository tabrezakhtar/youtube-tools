JavaScript Requirements
prefer speech marks over single quotes for strings and imports. e.g. import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
indent code using 2 spaces.
prefer useEffect hooks to have no dependencies passed in. I do not want them to re-run unless explicitly stated.
do not comment the code unless explicitly stated.
use emojis instead of svgs when creating code that uses icons.
prefer using the context api for any components that use state, instead of passing in callback functions.
when writing css, prefer to use tailwind.
do not use inline style tags
Folder Structure
keep the folder structure flat unless explicity told to do otherwise.
Chat Behaviour
do not run the app to check terminal output.
keep all responses short and concise. I do not want a conversational tone.
do not use em-dashes anywhere, use hyphens instead.
